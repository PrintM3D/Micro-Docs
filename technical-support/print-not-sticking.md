# Print Not Sticking



**Description of Problem**

Prints not sticking to the print bed can be caused by an inaccurate bed level and the M3D software. 

**Cause** + _Solution_

* **Peeling/Warping is seen at a print corner** - This could be due to incorrect nozzle height relative to the print bed. The best option is to manually decrease the offset value\(s\) to correct nozzle height position relative to the print bed. 
  * _Solution:_ Please view the [Bed Level Calibration](https://printm3d.com/solutions/article.php?id=216) article to fix.
* **Delamination** - At this point in time, happens more often while using ABS material type. You can view the [Printing with Phantom White ABS \(a.k.a. HIPS](https://micro.printm3d.com/guides/printing-with-phantom-white-abs-a.k.a.-hips)\) article to learn how to change temperature and fan settings during a print job.
