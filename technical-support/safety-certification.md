# Safety / Certification

M3D is a high volume american manufacturer of 3D Printers and all of  
its operations are based in \(Fulton, MD\).  We provide 3D printers so  
that a wide range of end users \(consumers, professional, and  
commercial\) may experience this new technology.  
  
**General Safety and Compliance**

As of 2016, The Micro 3D Printer is one of only a handful of 3D  
printers evaluated by a 3rd party \(UL labs\) to meet reasonable product  
safety standards, as this is not a requirement for 3D printers to be  
sold today.  What this means is that UL engineers studied common risk  
areas such as fire, shock, and other personal injury; if there was an  
obvious safety risk caused by excessive fumes they would have also  
noted this.  UL also evaluates our manufacturing on a regular basis,  
certifying that we are making our product consistently.  However, keep  
in mind that UL is not a health authority so these statements can not  
constitute any final health safety determination.  
  
The Micro 3D Printer has the UL Reference Certificate number  
US-25169-UL and conforms to IEC CB test standards: EN 60950-1:2006  
/A11:2009 /A1:2010/A12:2011/  IEC 60950-1\(ed.2\), IEC 60950-1\(ed.2\);am1  
and is issued to E470050-A1-CB-1.  Additionally the product meets CE  
and FCC testing requirements as well as RoHS material standards..  
  
**3D Printing Fumes**

As of Jan 2016, there was no formal testing standard or requirement  
for evaluating fumes generated in 3D printers.  Concerns of fume  
safety should be alleviated by limiting exposure - print in a well  
ventilated room or secondary space, keeping the printing nozzle clean  
of debris, and using high-quality established 3D printing materials  
\(like PLA\) rather than experimental ones.  If there is any perceived  
allergy or reaction, stop using the machine.  
  
To date, there have been no health reactions or obvious dangers  
reported to us.  In 2015, M3D had its products in the hands over over  
25,000+ end-users, many including schools and research labs.  We also  
have 50+ employees that work with 3D printers fully every day and have  
not had any reports of health concerns since our business was founded  
in late 2013.  Many people prefer using Tough 3D ink or PLA 3D Ink  
because they have very low odor.  However, these days most people  
choose to avoid ABS as a 3D printing material because it has a strong  
odor.  We also advise against using ABS as it is an outdated 3D  
printing material with numerous printing disadvantages.  In early  
2016, we are offering ABS-R and an alternative ABS replacement  
material that has nearly zero odor.  
  
As with many new products, because there are few established testing  
standards or formal requirements regarding 3D printer safety, the  
ultimate risk is up to the end-user to assume.  Additional information
