# Extruder Core Replacement Guide

First, please disconnect the printer from power and USB when performing this replacement to prevent electric static discharge \(ESD\) damage to the printer. It is recommended you ground yourself before working. 

      1. One side of the X Rods will be glued to the sliders, one side will not. Hold the slider in one hand 

          and the X Rack in the other.

      2. While holding the slider and X Rack, gently pull apart from each other. Please be careful as to

          not bend the Z Rods, only a small gap is needed.

      3. Rotate the slider so the pegs point upwards. The X Axis is now free from the sliders.

       3. Use a 5mm socket wrench to remove the nozzle from the extruder core

       Note: hold the heating unit above the lower part of the nozzle to keep it from spinning with the nozzle

                 while unscrewing the part.

     5. Tighten nozzle until 1 or 2 threads are showing below the metal housing

     6. Slide heating unit down to the end of the nozzle
