# How To Guide: X-Rod and Rack Replacement

**Here are some simple steps to replaced a damaged X-Rod and Rack:**

1. One side of the x-rods will be glued to the sliders, one side will not.  **Hold** the slider in one hand, and the x-rack in the other.

2. While holding the slider and X Rack, _gently_ **pull** apart from each other.  _Please **be careful** as to not bend the Z Rods, only a **small gap** is needed._

3.  **Rotate** the slider so the pegs point upwards. The X Axis is now free from the sliders.

4. **Take** the print head and begin to **slide** it off the x-rack towards the end that is free to remove from rack.  _Set print head aside_.

5. To remove the damaged rods, _carefully_ **wiggle** **and twist** the side that is glued to break the glue bond without applying too much force that will break the pegs on the slider  

   _**Note**: Remember which side the x-rack is located for next steps of replacing rods_

6. **Replace** the rods on the pegs in their correct locations with the print head installed.
7. With the extruder in the MIDDLE of the X-rods, **rotate** the rear X-rod to the tightest position. This will reduce the amount that the extruder wobbles.   
   _**Note:**_ Sometimes _you will have a rod that does not get tighter as you rotate it. That is ok, just move onto the next step._

8.  **Push** inwards on the sliders to make sure the rack is pressed into the sliders.

9. _While still pushing the sliders together,_ **push** the rear X-rod all the way to the RIGHT side. This ensures that if the rod is short and there is a gap on one side, the gap is next to the LEFT slider.

10. **Flip** the printer over and **glue** SPOT \#1 AND \#2 to the LEFT slider.

11. Once glue is set, you are ready to print again!
